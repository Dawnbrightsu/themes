		                        The most frequent and common mistake which players are doing is using the same account name for all the 
		                        servers they play (most of the time, account name matches e-mail adress as well). You should NOT do that. 
		                        Simply because it's making your account extremely vulnerable against hackers and "corrupted" staff team members.
		                        <br/><br/>
		                        
		                        <b>Tip:</b> If you really have problems remembering your account names, you may simply add a few numbers to your original account name.<br/><br/>
								<b>Tip:</b> do not use simple account names like "johny" "michael" "leetpro" etc. Use an abstract word or a 
		                        variation of severalwords. Account must consist of both letters and numbers.<br/><br/>
		                        <b>Tip:</b> Make a text file, where you can save all your private information about accounts. 
		                        This way you won't forget your personal info.(I do that myself) But make sure you have a copy if this text 
		                        file saved somewhere and make sure you're always protected by antivirus.

		                       	There are a lot of people who share the same account. This is a very bad idea. This completely compromizes accounts security and here are a few reasons why:
	                            <br/><br/>
	                            1. 
	                            You may be sure that the guy you gave your account info is a relayable person. - WRONG. 
	                            NEVER EVER trust anyone, especially those so-called "friends" you've found on the web are not friends at all. 
	                            You've never seen them, you've never heard them - how can you trust it?
	                            <br/><br/>
	                            2. Trying to trade your account is another stupid idea. First of all, if you think you can earn some money using obsidianwow 
	                            server you need to think again. The person who are you trying with can simply screenshot conversation which will 
	                            lead to your account permament suspenion. Trading accounts on obsidianwow  is general not even possible because 
	                            you cannot change account e-mail -> cannot change password of "newly" traded account. Use common sense and never sell/trade your account.
